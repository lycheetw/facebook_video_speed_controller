[Web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fnacfacghijplbkdbohijibfpldedpeb)

## How
The main idea is using html5 video tag to control playing speed.
1. Using `MutationObserver` to catch new video block when user scrolling web page.
2. Adding control panel into setting block


## TODO
Facebook will changes their web structure sometimes. It may cause extension stop working.
